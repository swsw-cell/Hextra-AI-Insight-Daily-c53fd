### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Figure 03 kitchen demo is going viral!** Figure AI's latest robot has just dropped, featuring the **Helix 02 system**. This bot is crushing it in the kitchen, operating autonomously without human intervention. It smoothly closes drawers with its hip and even lifts dishwasher doors with its foot — talk about some seriously impressive full-body coordination! 🤯 [Figure AI News (AI Info)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652673084&idx=3&sn=98cf2158bea20402903319d46f21e150)<br/>![AI Info: Figure 03 Robot Operating Dishwasher in Kitchen](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/news_01kgyv6z18efman4df18dk0w3p.gif)<br/>
2.  **Helix 02's three-layer brain architecture has been revealed!** The system sports a **S0/S1/S2** three-tiered design. S0 is like the cerebellum, handling balance control at 1kHz. S1 integrates all sensors, orchestrating the entire body at 200Hz. Meanwhile, S2 comprehends language and plans tasks, finally waving goodbye to the era of 'turn-based' robots. Game changer! ✨ [Technical Details (AI Info)](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix-02)
3.  **Figure 03's fingertips just got an upgrade for delicate tasks!** Now sporting palm cameras and tactile sensors. It can feel forces as low as 3 grams, making pill-picking a breeze. From twisting bottle caps to pushing syringes, it handles everything with precise control. Now *that's* what we call a truly dexterous hand! 🦾 [Source (AI Info)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652673084&idx=3&sn=98cf2158bea20402903319d46f21e150)
4.  **Claude Code just dropped a Fast mode!** This baby boosts output speed by **2.5x** 🚀, but get this — it's 5x the price. That means you're burning cash 12.5x faster, making hundreds of dollars a day disappear into thin air a very real possibility. Cha-ching! 💸 [Official Docs (AI Info)](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Anthropic has unleashed its Skills building guide!** This official 33-page comprehensive tutorial just dropped. At its core, a Skill is essentially a YAML + Markdown package of 'instructional materials.' It features a three-tier progressive disclosure, loading only when needed. Super handy! ✨ [Guide Download (AI Info)](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf?hsLang=en)<br/>![AI Info: Anthropic Skills Guide Document Cover](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/53362891aa62984addd94ea76410ec3a.avif)<br/>
2.  **The relationship between Skill and MCP? Think kitchen!** MCP is like a pro kitchen, providing all the tools, while Skill is the recipe, giving you the steps. There are five major practical modes covering workflow orchestration and multi-service coordination. Without Skill, MCP leaves you with all the tools but no clue how to use 'em. What a waste! 🤔 [Details (AI Info)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2020491406423490782)<br/>

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **The AI investment frenzy is causing multiple shortages!** GPUs, RAM, power, and skilled technicians are all in high demand. Some estimate an additional **$650 billion in annual revenue** is needed for a reasonable return. We're talking about purchased GPUs just sitting in warehouses, unable to power up. The bubble debate is heating up big time! 🤯 [Washington Post (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46922969)<br/>
2.  **White-collar layoffs and blue-collar shortages are happening simultaneously.** Software designers are getting the axe, while electrician training takes years. Discussions about UBI are resurfacing, and worries about damaged consumer spending power are spreading. Eroding tax bases and wealth concentration among a few giants are becoming major focal points. Yikes! 😬 [Source (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46922969)<br/>
3.  **The fear of 'AI slop' is sparking a quality debate.** A whopping 90% of 'good enough' products are flooding the market. Some worry about amplified skill degradation and artists/artisans being squeezed out. Adobe's stock dip is a clear signal: business models are facing a massive reshape. Wild times! 🎨 [HN Discussion (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46933067)<br/>
4.  **Software engineering is circling back to its design core!** In the AI era, design trumps line-by-line coding. 'Vibe coding' risks are being flagged, and security audits are becoming a new barrier. Prompt engineering and `agents.md` are the hot new skillsets, but frameworks still hold their value. Back to basics, kinda! 💻 [Original Text (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46923543)<br/>
5.  **Predicting the biggest Token consumption scenarios?** 'Greed, lust, and fear of death' are the real necessities. Adult websites have already proven to be the strongest in commercialization. Investment in healthcare computing power is still nowhere near enough. Birth, old age, sickness, death, plus entertainment to fill time — these are the certainties. Can't argue with that! 🤷‍♀️ [Jike (AI Info)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/69886fa6c5a1d4e6492129cc)<br/>

### Social Media Buzz

1.  **Opus 4.6's independent thinking capability is blowing minds!** ChatGPT is often too flattering, easily leading you to self-congratulation. But with Opus, checking out its thought process gives you an intuitive sense of its super high IQ. While Codex 5.3 is great for coding, its thinking is weaker. For daily use, Opus is definitely the top pick. Smart move! 🧠 [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/2020264186081898764)<br/>![AI Info: Opus 4.6 Model Thinking Process Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/9151e408734fa2670f5728b50f041f10.avif)<br/>
2.  **The history of code typists is cycling back around!** Remember that old joke about 'handing off code to a typist'? Well, now we just articulate our ideas, and watch AI churn out the code. We've come full circle; the typist has become AI. Wild, right? 🤯 [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/frxiaobei/status/2020317743443312693)<br/>
3.  **Seedance 2.0 can create videos from a single sentence!** The professional editing touches are the biggest surprise. However, the inability to turn off subtitles is a major issue, and there are many Chinese typos. Room for improvement, for sure! 🤔 [Tweet Video (AI Info)](https://x.com/gefei55/status/2020287739602911537)
4.  **The backend moat? Just needs someone to take the blame!** Try tackling 'shit mountain' code with GPT-5.3-codex or Opus 4.6. If your test coverage is solid, they can pretty much handle anything. Break down microservices into smaller chunks, and Agents can easily get the job done. Smooth sailing! ⛵ [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2020185462175068538)<br/>
