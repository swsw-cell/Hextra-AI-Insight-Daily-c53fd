### Cutting-Edge Research 🔬

1.  **DeepSeek founder drops new mHC architecture.**
    **DeepSeek's new mHC architecture** just dropped, personally co-authored by founder Liang Wenfeng and released on New Year's Day! 🎉 This heavyweight [mHC Architecture Paper (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-01-02-7) tackles the instability that often plagues **large model training**. The team introduced manifold-constrained hyper-connection technology, which, by projecting matrices onto bi-stochastic manifolds, ensures signal propagation's energy conservation ⚡. This isn't just solving numerical explosion issues; it's also slashing VRAM overhead big time! 🤯

2.  **DAVE model is all about document visual understanding.**
    **DAVE model** is here to save the day! 🦸‍♂️ Current VLM visual encoders can't quite get complex layouts, right? Well, DAVE is the [Vision Expert (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17221) purpose-built for this! It's specifically designed for 📄 document understanding and web agents, and get this: it doesn't even need expensive, large-scale labeled data. Thanks to self-supervised pre-training, DAVE absolutely crushes parsing tasks, totally filling in the gaps left by general visual encoders. 🚀

3.  **SpaceTimePilot nails video spatio-temporal decoupling.**
    **SpaceTimePilot** is here to make your video dreams come true! 🤩 Want to call the shots on camera moves 🎥 and timing in your videos? SpaceTimePilot pulls off incredible [Spatio-Temporal Decoupling (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25075)! It can independently change camera views or adjust the speed of actions 🏃‍♂️, and they won't mess with each other. This generative rendering tech makes exploring dynamic scenes totally on your terms. ✨
