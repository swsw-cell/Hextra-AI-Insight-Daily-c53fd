### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Figure 03**'s kitchen demo is absolutely blowing up! 💪 Figure AI's latest robot just dropped, powered by the **Helix 02 system**. This bot is crushing kitchen tasks autonomously – it smoothly closes drawers with its hip and even lifts the dishwasher door with its foot. Talk about full-body coordination – impressive stuff! Check out the [Figure AI News (AI Info)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652673084&idx=3&sn=98cf2158bea20402903319d46f21e150) for more. <br/>![AI Info: Figure 03 Robot Operating Dishwasher in Kitchen](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/news_01kgyv6z18efman4df18dk0w3p.gif)<br/>

2.  The **Helix 02** system's three-tier 'brain' architecture has been revealed! 🧠 It uses an **S0/S1/S2** design. S0 acts like a cerebellum, handling balance control at 1kHz. S1 integrates all sensors, orchestrating full-body commands at 200Hz. S2 understands language and plans tasks, finally waving goodbye to the 'turn-based' robot era. Get the [Technical Details (AI Info)](https://www.figure.ai/news/helix-02).

3.  Okay, **Figure 03**'s fingertips are seriously next-level! Its new palm camera and tactile sensors can detect forces as low as 3 grams, making tasks like picking up a pill a breeze. It can precisely control things like twisting bottle caps and pushing syringes. Now *that's* what we call true dexterity! 🤯 Find out more here: [Source (AI Info)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI3MTA0MTk1MA==&mid=2652673084&idx=3&sn=98cf2158bea20402903319d46f21e150).

4.  **Claude Code** just rolled out its new **Fast mode**! 🚀 You'll get a **2.5x** speed boost, but be ready for a 5x price hike. That means your spending velocity jumps by 12.5x – burning hundreds of bucks a day isn't just a dream anymore. Check out the [Official Documentation (AI Info)](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode) for details. <br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Anthropic** has dropped its official 33-page **Skills building guide**! 📚 Essentially, a Skill is 'teaching material' packaged as YAML + Markdown. It uses a three-tier progressive disclosure model, loading only when needed. Grab the [Guide Download (AI Info)](https://resources.anthropic.com/hubfs/The-Complete-Guide-to-Building-Skill-for-Claude.pdf?hsLang=en) here. <br/>![AI Info: Anthropic Skills Guide Document Cover](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/53362891aa62984addd94ea76410ec3a.avif)<br/>

2.  Think of the **Skill and MCP relationship** like a kitchen: MCP is the professional kitchen providing the tools, while Skill is the recipe providing the steps. There are five major practical modes covering workflow orchestration and multi-service coordination. Without Skills, MCP is like having all the fancy tools but no idea how to cook! 🍳 Get the [Details (AI Info)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/2020491406423490782). <br/>

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  The **AI investment boom** is causing a cascade of shortages. 📈 GPUs, RAM, power, and skilled technicians are all in tight supply. Some estimate an additional **$650 billion in annual revenue** is needed just for a reasonable return. We've got purchased GPUs piling up in warehouses, but no power to run 'em – the 'bubble' debate is heating up! 🔥 Read more from the [Washington Post (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46922969). <br/>

2.  Here's a weird one: **white-collar layoffs are happening right alongside blue-collar shortages**. Software designers are getting cut, while electrician training takes years. Discussions around Universal Basic Income (UBI) are resurfacing, with worries about damaged consumer spending power spreading. 📉 Erosion of the tax base and wealth centralization among a few giants are becoming major focal points. Dive deeper here: [Source (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46922969). <br/>

3.  The **fear of AI 'slop'** is sparking some serious quality debates. 😱 About 90% of 'good enough' AI-generated content is flooding the market. Some worry about skill degradation being amplified, pushing artists and craftspeople out. Adobe's stock drop is a signal that business models are facing a major shake-up. Check out the [HN Discussion (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46933067). <br/>

4.  **Software engineering** is getting back to its design roots. In the AI era, design is way more crucial than line-by-line coding. Warnings are out about 'vibe coding' risks, and security audits are the new hurdle. Prompt engineering and `agents.md` are becoming essential new skill sets, but frameworks still hold their value. Read the [Original (AI Info)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46923543). <br/>

5.  So, what are the **largest token consumption scenarios** predicted? 🤔 Apparently, 'greed, lust, and fear of death' are the true 'must-haves.' Adult websites have already proven to be the strongest commercializers. Investment in healthcare computing power is still nowhere near enough. Birth, aging, sickness, death, plus entertainment to fill the time – these are the sure bets! Check out the [Jike (AI Info)](https://m.okjike.com/originalPosts/69886fa6c5a1d4e6492129cc). <br/>

### Top Open-Source Projects

1.  **Claude-Mem** has officially hit the top of the GitHub trending list! ⭐ This persistent memory system, with 2.3k stars, directly tackles the pain point of cross-session amnesia. Its three-tier progressive retrieval 🚀 saves a whopping **90% of Tokens**. 'Endless mode' cuts it by 95% and boosts tool call limits by 20x. Pretty wild! 🤯 Check out the [GitHub Repo (AI Info)](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem).

2.  **Pydantic** has rolled out **Monty**, a minimal and secure Python interpreter! 🔥 Written in Rust with 2.2k stars, it's specifically designed for AI use, offering more controlled code execution. Find it on [GitHub (AI Info)](https://github.com/pydantic/monty). <br/>

3.  **MiniCPM-o** is reportedly hitting Gemini levels! 🤩 This visual-voice multimodal real-time stream has garnered 23.3k stars 🚀. It runs on mobile, enabling full-duplex conversations. Made by OpenBMB, it's a mobile game-changer! See it on [GitHub (AI Info)](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-o). <br/>

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Opus 4.6**'s independent thinking capability is seriously impressive! ✨ ChatGPT can be a bit too flattering and might lead you astray. But with Opus, when you see its thought process, you just get this intuitive feeling that its IQ is through the roof! While Codex 5.3 is strong for coding, its thinking is weaker. For daily use, Opus is the go-to choice. Check out the [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/2020264186081898764). <br/>![AI Info: Opus 4.6 Model Thinking Process Screenshot](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/02/9151e408734fa2670f5728b50f041f10.avif)<br/>

2.  Talk about a blast from the past! The joke used to be, 'Just give the code to the data entry person.' Now, **we outline our ideas, and watch AI type out the code**. 🤖 It's like we've come full circle, and the 'data entry person' is now AI. Wild! Check out this [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/frxiaobei/status/2020317743443312693). <br/>

3.  **Seedance 2.0** can whip up a video from a single sentence! The biggest surprise? The professional editing touches are spot on! 🤩 However, the major downside is that you can't turn off the subtitles, and there are a ton of Chinese typos. See the [Tweet Video (AI Info)](https://x.com/gefei55/status/2020287739602911537).

4.  When it comes to **backend moats**, it seems the only missing piece is someone to take the blame! 😂 Try throwing some 'spaghetti code' at GPT-5.3-codex or Opus 4.6. If your test coverage is decent, they can generally handle it. Break down microservices into smaller chunks, and agents can easily tackle them. Check out this [Tweet (AI Info)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2020185462175068538). <br/>
