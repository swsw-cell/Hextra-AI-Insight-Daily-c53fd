# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (we'll just call it "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into all the cool stuff we offer, please take a moment to really read through these Terms of Service. By hitting up our Site or using any of our services, you're basically saying "Yep, I'm cool with these terms."

## 1. Service Introduction
The Site offers users a sweet package of paid subscription content and member services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up, some content is only for our subscribed members!

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   Users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
*   Users are solely responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **no transferring or sharing** your account!
*   The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they breach these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, and the exact fees are clearly laid out on the checkout page.
*   All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal), so relax – the Site doesn't store any of your payment info.
*   Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel them before your current billing cycle ends.
*   Our **14-Day Refund Policy** applies to first-time subscribers. If you're not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can snag a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're opting out. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued post-payment, unless required by law.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
*   All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our permission.
*   Users only get **non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights** to the content, strictly for personal learning and reading.
*   For commercial use or extensive quoting, please reach out to the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Users are **prohibited** from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
*   It's also a big **no-no** to bulk download, crawl, or crack member-only content using technical means.
*   The Site reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice.
*   The Site will **not be liable for any compensation** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer
*   The information provided on this Site is purely for reference and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical advice).
*   The Site is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using the Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law
*   These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
*   Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations hit a wall, you agree to submit the dispute to the competent courts of Santa Clara County, California.
