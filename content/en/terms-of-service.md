Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (hereinafter referred to as "**the Site**" or "**we**"). Before you dive into using the Site's services, please give these Terms of Service a thorough read. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms. ✨

## 1. Service Introduction
**The Site** offers users paid subscription content and membership services. This includes, but isn't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up: some content is only available to our subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Account
- **Users** need to provide a valid email address and set a password to register for an account.
- **Users** are totally responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. **Absolutely no transferring or sharing** your account, folks!
- **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- **Subscription services** are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- **All payments** are processed via third-party platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store your payment info. 🛡️
- **Subscriptions** will **auto-renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- **Our 14-day refund policy** is pretty sweet for first-time subscribers! If you're not stoked with the service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally apply for a full refund. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or for non-first-time subscriptions, **no refunds** will be issued after payment, unless the law specifically requires it. 💸

- **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban any violating users**. Consider yourself warned! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
- **We** reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just a heads-up! 🔄
- **The Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just happen beyond our control!
