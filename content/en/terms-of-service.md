# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! 👋 Before diving into our services, please take a moment to read these Terms of Service carefully. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially giving us a virtual high-five that you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. Service Overview
The Site offers users paid subscription content and membership services, including but not limited to awesome blog posts, exclusive resources, ebooks, and community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of this cool content is only accessible to our subscribed users.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
- Users need to provide a valid email address and set up a password to register for an account.
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Seriously, **don't** transfer or share your account – it's a big no-no! 🚫
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they're caught violating these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly/annual basis, with fees clearly displayed on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party platforms (like Stripe and PayPal), so rest assured, the Site doesn't store your payment info. 👍
- Subscriptions will **automatically renew** unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- Our **14-day Refund Policy** is pretty straightforward: first-time subscribers who aren't totally stoked about our service can apply for a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're bouncing. Each user gets one shot at this refund. After 14 days, or if it's not your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law says otherwise. No exceptions! 💰

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
- All original content is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. Please don't copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without authorization – that's just not cool. 🙅‍♀️
- Users are granted only a **non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access** the content, strictly for personal learning and reading.
- For commercial use or extensive citation, please reach out to the Site to get proper authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
- It's strictly **forbidden** to upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes upon others' rights. Play nice, folks! 😇
- Also, **don't even think about** bulk downloading, scraping, or cracking member content using technical means. Seriously, that's not how we roll. 🛠️
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban rule-breaking users**. Consider this your fair warning! 🚨

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Just giving you a heads-up! 🤷‍♀️
- The Site **won't be held responsible for any damages** if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server issues, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things just go sideways!

## 7. Disclaimer
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical stuff). We're not your gurus here! 🧠
- The Site **won't be responsible** for any direct or indirect losses users might incur from using our content or services. Use your best judgment, always! 🙏

## 8. Governing Law
- These Terms of Service are governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
- Any disputes arising from or related to these terms should first be resolved through friendly negotiation between both parties. If negotiations fail, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California. ⚖️
